# SwashTV
SwashTV automated water surface tracing tool

# What does the code do?
The 'swash_tv_unet_processor.ipynb' script takes a distortion corrected and rectified video (e.g. 7_10_swash_tv_07_07_2023_2_11940.0_slomo_1p9.mp4) and returns a beach slope rotated video with the swash water profile annotated. A csv file of the x,t,z,h data is saved as well as a depth timestack graph.
